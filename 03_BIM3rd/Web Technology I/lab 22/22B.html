          Nepal is a beautiful country located in South Asia, bordered by China to the north and
          India to the south, east, and west. It is home to the world's highest peak, Mount Everest,
          as well as other stunning mountain ranges, lakes, rivers, and diverse wildlife. If you're
          planning to visit Nepal in 2023, here are some things you may want to consider: Best time
          to visit: The best time to visit Nepal is during the autumn season (September-November)
          and spring season (March-May) when the weather is mild, and the skies are clear. These
          seasons are perfect for trekking, sightseeing, and outdoor activities. Visa requirements:
          Visitors to Nepal must obtain a visa before arrival. You can either apply for a visa
          online or get one on arrival at the airport. You will need to provide a passport with at
          least six months' validity and a recent passport-sized photo.
