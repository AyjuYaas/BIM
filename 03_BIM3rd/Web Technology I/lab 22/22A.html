          Nepal, officially the Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal, is a landlocked country in
          South Asia. It is mainly situated in the Himalayas, but also includes parts of the
          Indo-Gangetic Plain. It borders the Tibet Autonomous Region of China to the north, and
          India in the south, east, and west, while it is narrowly separated from Bangladesh by the
          Siliguri Corridor, and from Bhutan by the Indian state of Sikkim. Nepal has a diverse
          geography, including fertile plains, subalpine forested hills, and eight of the world's
          ten tallest mountains, including Mount Everest, the highest point on Earth. Kathmandu is
          the nation's capital and the largest city. Nepal is a multi-ethnic, multi-lingual,
          multi-religious and multi-cultural state, with Nepali as the official language.
