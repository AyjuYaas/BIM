    <p align="center"><strong>THE ROAD NOT TAKEN</strong></p>
    <p align="right">-BY ROBERT FROST</p>
    <p align="left">
      Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,<br />
      And sorry I could not travel both <br />
      And be one traveler, long I stood <br />
      And looked down one as far as I could <br />
      To where it bent in the undergrowth; <br />
    </p>
    <p align="right">
      Then took the other, as just as fair, <br />
      And having perhaps the better claim, <br />
      Because it was grassy and wanted wear; <br />
      Though as for that the passing there <br />
      Had worn them really about the same, <br />

    <p align="justify">
      Robert Lee Frost (March 26, 1874 - January 29, 1963) was an American poet. His work was
      initially published in England before it was published in the United States. Known for his
      realistic depictions of rural life and his command of American colloquial speech,[2] Frost
      frequently wrote about settings from rural life in New England in the early 20th century,
      using them to examine complex social and philosophical themes.
